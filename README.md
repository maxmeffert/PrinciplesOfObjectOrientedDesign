# Principles of Object Oriented Design
Repository for slide-ware and talks on _Principles of Object Oriented Design_.

## Methodology

The idea is to introduce _Principles of Object Oriented Design_ with a cause-effect relationship regarding _Software Qualities_, i.e. the principle states an axiomatic "law" which if obeyed (the cause) introduces or improves one or more qualities constituting "good" software (the effect).

## Software Qualities

### Correctness
_Correctness is the ability of software products to perform their exact tasks, as defined by their specification._ [1]

### Robustness
_Robustness is the ability of software systems to react appropriately to abnormal conditions._ [1]

### Extendibility
_Extendibility is the ease of adapting software products to changes of specification._ [1]

### Reusability
_Reusability is the ability of software elements to serve for the construction of many different applications._ [1]

### Compatibility
_Compatibility is the ease of combining software elements with others._ [1]

### Efficiency
_Efficiency is the ability of a software system to place as few demands as possible on hardware resources, such as processor time, space occupied in internal and external memories, bandwidth used in communication devices._ [1]

### Portability
_Portability is the ease of transferring software products to various hardware and software environments._ [1]

### Ease of Use
_Ease of use is the ease with which people of various backgrounds and qualifications can learn to use software products and apply them to solve problems. It also covers the ease of installation, operation and monitoring._ [1]

### Functionality
_Functionality is the extent of possibilities provided by a system._ [1]

### Timeliness
_Timeliness is the ability of a software system to be released when or before its users want it._ [1]
