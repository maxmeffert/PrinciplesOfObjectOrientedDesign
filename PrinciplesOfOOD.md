### Principles of
# Object Oriented Design

---

# Object Orientation
* A description of a system using interacting and cooperating objects.
* An object is composed of 
  * _attributes_ (data) 
  * _operations_ (behavior)

---

# Object Oriented Design
The activity of planning of a system using interacting and cooperating objects.

---

# Prinicple = Best Practice

* _Principles_
  * are axiomatic laws based on observation
  * assume causality between 
    * obidience of such law (cause) 
    * and the final outcome of that obidience (effect)

## Principles of OOD

Axiomatic laws for designing "good" object oriented software (elements), i.e. software (elements) with one or more _Software Qualities_.

---

### An incomplete list of Software Qualities
Correctness, Robustness, Extendibility, Reusability, Compatibility, Efficiency, Portability, Ease of use, Functionality, Timeliness, Verfiability, Integrity, Repairability, Economy, Maintainability, Comprehensibility, ...

## Single Responsibility Principle

**Cause:** 
_There should never be more than one reason for a class to change._
**Effect:** 
Verfiability, Repairability, Maintainability
